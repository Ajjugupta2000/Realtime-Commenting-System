# Realtime-Commenting-System
Real-time comment system using Socket.io, Node.js, and MongoDB allows for seamless communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server, enabling real-time updates to be delivered to the client without requiring the client to constantly refresh the page.
# Tech Stack
## - Frontend:

1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface.
2. Socket.io client library to communicate with the server.
## - Backend:

1. Node.js, a JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
2. Express.js or other Node.js web frameworks for handling APIs and HTTP requests and responses.
3. Socket.io server library for handling real-time communication between clients and the server.

## - Database
MongoDB or other NoSQL databases for storing comments and related data.

# How to Use
- Download or clone the repository    
   `git clone https://github.com/Ajjugupta2000/Realtime-Commenting-System.git`
- Install any dependencies required by the project by running the below command in the terminal   
   `npm install`   
   This command will install all the Node.js dependencies listed in the package.json file.
- Run command   
   `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`   
Note : first install nodemon by running command `npm nodemon`
- Open the application in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000 or the appropriate URL provided by the application.
- To see the live typing and real-time updates of the comment section on a web page, follow these steps:
   1. Open two tabs in your web browser with the same URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
   2. In one tab, type a comment in the comment section
   3. In the other tab, you will be able to see the live typing of the comment as it is being typed
   4. Once the comment is submitted in the first tab, the comment section will be updated in both tabs, and both users will be able to see the comment.
- Download and install MongoDB Compass to collect the database
